*Spring for Stardog*

This is Spring integration for Stardog, the RDF database. See
http://stardog.com/docs/spring for more information, when it's ready.

Current build / install instructions:

Note: Gradle Eclipse plugin (e.g. in SpringSource Tool Suite does not honor JVM parameters.
      Work around is to drop stardog license file in the stardog-spring workspace folder itself.

 - Edit build.gradle and change the stardogLocation variable (line 18) 
   to a local Stardog release directory
 - Don't forget to set an environment variable or JVM parameter for stardog home
 - As of Stardog 0.9.6, don't forget to get your license and drop it in stardog home
 - Run "gradlew", this will download gradle and fully bootstrap a gradle
   build environment
 - Run "gradlew build", which will resolve dependencies, compile, and
   package everything up.  The resulting stardog-spring.jar is then in the
   build/libs directory.
 - Run "gradlew install", which will perform the build, generate a POM, and
   install that POM in your local maven repo.  However, this POM will not contain
   any of the stardog dependencies - only the Spring dependencies.  We can 
   change this once a Stardog pom exists.

If you aren't a Stardog tester (or user or customer), you won't be able to
compile Spring for Stardog. Please see http://stardog.com/testing for access
to the alpha/beta test program.
