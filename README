*Spring for Stardog*

This is Spring integration for Stardog, the RDF database. These bindings
provide Spring aware beans to provide an analogous feature set to Spring's
jdbcTemplate.  Spring Bach reader/writers are also included.

Recent Changes:
  1.1: 
    * Validated compatibility with Stardog 1.1
    * Upgraded Spring dependencies to 3.1.2 RELEASE
    * Added some common RowMappers to ext.spring.mapper package
    * Increased test coverage, adding Emma to build

Current build / install instructions:

  - Note: Gradle Eclipse plugin (e.g. in SpringSource Tool Suite does not honor JVM parameters.
      Work around is to drop stardog license file in the stardog-spring workspace folder itself.
 - Edit build.gradle and change the stardogLocation variable (line 18) 
   to a local Stardog release directory
 - Don't forget to set an environment variable or JVM parameter for stardog home
 - Run "gradlew", this will download gradle and fully bootstrap a gradle
   build environment
 - Run "gradlew build", which will resolve dependencies, compile, and
   package everything up.  The resulting stardog-spring.jar is then in the
   build/libs directory.
 - Run "gradlew install", which will perform the build, generate a POM, and
   install that POM in your local maven repo.  However, this POM will not contain
   any of the stardog dependencies - only the Spring dependencies.  We can 
   change this once a Stardog pom exists.

If you aren't a Stardog tester (or user or customer), you won't be able to
compile Spring for Stardog. Please see http://stardog.com/testing for access
to the alpha/beta test program.
